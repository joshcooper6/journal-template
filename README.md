# Node.JS Journal Template

As a developer, I wanted something I can easily implement locally but also hosted in the cloud. I did not want to have to create an elaborate new blog project, or keep a basic .doc file of my progress.

Instead, the <b>create.js</b> file will create new Markdown files based on the present day. These files will be organized in their respective files that this program will automatically render.

As of January 2023, I will begin incorporating daily journals into all of my projects when working on them to accurately track process and collaboration notes.

## To get started...
- Download the respository into your own project.
- Go where the <b>create.js</b> file exists in your project through the command line and enter the following:

```sh
node create
```

- If you want to create your own file name, type: 'node create NAME_HERE'

```sh
node create NAME_HERE
```

- Watch the magic happen! 

## Technologies Used
